# Example support files for Rynner

## Host file

The file `host` is a prototype file for the files contained in the
`${HOME}/.rynner/hosts/` directory. Replace the values of `domain`,
`username`, and `rsa_file` with data for your cluster. The value of
`classname` should be one of: `SlurmHost`, `PBSHost`.
